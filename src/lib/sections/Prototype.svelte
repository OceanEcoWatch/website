			We've built a small prototype to detect marine debris on the coast of Durban located in South
			Africa where a flood event on the 18th of April in 2019 washed out a lot of plastic. We are
			using data from the sentinel-2 satellite taken six days post-event. Our prototype highlights
			potential locations of floating plastic. Each point on the map corresponds to the probability
			of present marine debris and represents an area spanning 10x10 mÂ².
